# Bug Free

Bug Free :tm: is a simple checklist web application.
It is primarily designed for mobile.

# Getting Started

Fork this repo in preperation for your interview.

There are two folders:

- app
- server

They should be self explanitory.

# Goal

Your job is to build an application according to the following specifications:

- our openapi spec found in `./server/spec.yaml`
- our [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/VdPxX5j1v7bdZ1xAxBosD4/To-do-list?node-id=1-2&t=uGeU8WId2BW7FAVC-1)

If you would like a more human readable version of the spec copy-paste it into the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io).

Dont rush, do what you can. We are more interested in your process than a finished product.

# Technology

Use whatever is most comfortable
